| Mobility participation rate, modal split, daily travel distance and time | Berlin:<br>≈ 90 % of Berlin’s population is mobile on a typical day, making 3.7 trips per person and travelling ≈ 20 km in 92 min.<br><br>Modal split (tripbased) for Berlin:<br>34 % on foot,<br>26 % public transport,<br>22 % car (MIV),<br>18 % bicycle.<br><br>Frankfurt a.M.:<br>≈ 91 % of Frankfurt’s population is mobile on a typical day, making 3.8 trips per person and travelling ≈ 20 km in 85 min.<br><br>Modal split (tripbased) for Frankfurt a.M.:<br>37 % on foot,<br>23 % car (MIV),<br>20 % public transport,<br>20 % bicycle.<br><br>Hamburg:<br>≈ 3.0 trips/day and 28 km/day/person;<br>Modal split in 2022 was roughly<br>32 % car (MIV),<br>24 % public transport,<br>22 % bicycle,<br>22 % walking, up from 2017 when cycling was 15 % and car use 36 %.<br><br>Munich:<br>≈ 92 % of Munich’s population is mobile on a typical day, making 3.7 trips per person and travelling ≈ 20 km in 84 min.<br><br>Modal split (tripbased) for Munich:<br>32 % on foot,<br>24 % public transport,<br>23 % bicycle,<br>21 % car (MIV).<br>≈ 62 % of respondents used multiple modes in a typical week.<br><br>Dresden:<br>≈ 94 % of Dresden’s population is mobile on a typical day, making 3.8 trips per person and travelling ≈ 18 km in 82 min.<br><br>Modal split (tripbased) for Dresden:<br>34 % walking,<br>29 % car (MIV),<br>21 % public transport,<br>16 % bicycle.<br><br>National (2023): MiD 2023 shows that about 82 % of people leave the house on a typical day (down from 85 % in 2017); participation is 84 % on weekdays, 79 % on Saturdays and 71 % on Sundays | SrV 2023, MiD 2023 |
| Mode share (tripbased) | Germany/national data: Modal split shifted away from the car. Walking accounts for 26 % of trips, cycling 11 %, car drivers 40 %, car passengers 13 % and public transport 11 %. This marks a four-percentage-point decline in the motorised individual transport share compared with 2017 | MiD 2023 |
| Mode share (distancebased) | National (2023): for passenger-kilometres the motorised individual transport still dominates but its share fell slightly. MiD 2023 estimates that car drivers account for ≈ 54 % of person-kilometres and car passengers ≈ 19 % (together ≈ 73 %). Public transport contributes ≈ 19 %, while cycling and walking each account for ≈ 4 % of the kilometres.<br><br>Berlin: 43 % public transport, 38 % car (MIV), 13 % bicycle, 6 % on foot.<br>Dresden: 34 % walking, 29 % car (MIV), 21 % public transport, 16 % bicycle.<br>Frankfurt a.M.: 47 % car (MIV), 31 % public transport, 15 % bicycle, 7 % on foot.<br>Hamburg: 43 % car (MIV), 42 % public transport, 11 % bicycle and 4 % walking.<br>Munich: 40 % public transport, 38 % car (MIV), 16 % bicycle, 6 % on foot. | MiD 2023, SrV 2023 |
